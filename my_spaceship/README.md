# Welcome to My Spaceship
***

## Task
Create a function that takes in a flight path of a rocket ship as a string of letters and returns the following format:
"{x: X, y: Y, direction: 'DIRECTION'}"
X,Y represent the ending coordinates of your ship and direction represents its final direction.

## Description
The problem is solved with the help of function my_spaceship.

## Installation
This project does not require installation.

## Usage
Your ship simulator should accept a string of letters that represent the intended flight path for a particular missile ship.

There are only 3 admissible movement options on the ship's flight path; R to turn right, L to turn left and A to move forward.

If, for example, you receive "RRALAA" as the flight path, you should interpret this as: Turn right, turn right, advance, turn left, advance, advance After receiving this initial flight path, the program returns the x ,y coordinates of the vessel's final destination, as well as its orientation relative to the starting point.

Orientation is represented as left, right, up or down.
